=====================================================
              Loops
=====================================================
All programing languages need a way to execute block of code many times, this is possible with loops
Python has two types of loops:
	for loop
	while loop
	
-for loop -- used to iterate over a sequence(list,tuple,string) or other iterable objects
-while loop -- while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied

loops is repeating task of Python
each repetition is called iteration

			For loop
------------------------------------------------------------
for [variable] in [list]
when it is loop, Python is looking after what is after "in"

my list=[value1,value2,value3...]

for each_value in my list "(or)" [value1,value2,value3...]:
	print(each_value):

for each in [list]:
	print ("hello", each)		--this script will print every time hello with the all of the numbers of the list

!for		--starting keyword for loop
!each 		--prints every line under the loop

each_char		--Python takes each character in string for a loop
!print("string", each_char)		--Python will print iteractions with the given characters + the chars
each_value		--Python will print each value of the list along with given string

					Range funcion
--------------------------------------------------------
range(funcion)		-- built in Python value, which makes integers from a range pf numbers, or makes range objects
syntax of range:
	range(start,stop,step)
	3 arguments ==> By default if it is one argument is stop, if there is two is start/stop, 3 - start, stop, step
	
						While loop
------------------------------------------------------------
While loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is True
We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.


while True:
	print("string")						--prints ("string") infinite number of times

value=[number]
while value <= condition:
	print(value)
	value=value+condition				-- prints the (value) until condition is met
	
						Loop control statements
------------------------------------------------------------
Control statements:
-break				--breaks the loop 
-continue			--just skips/mask the code within the code block for continue and the loop proceeds
-pass				-- it just passes the loop and don't trigger output error
